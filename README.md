# UGAHacks 11 Project: Healthcare Helper (Python Streamlit Application)


Members: Disha Dhangar


Purpose: Finding the right healthcare service can be confusing and time-consuming, especially for people who aren't sure where to go. Many communities struggle to locate nearby hospitals, clinics, or specialists quickly. "Healtcare Helper" solves this problem by providing an easy-to-use application that allows user sto search for nearby healthcare services and view essential details such as distance, address, and type of service. This helps users make informed decisions and access care faster.


Tools Utilized: Copilot and ChatGPT were utilized to make planning, designing, implementing, and testing the application easy and efficient. They assisted with debugging, generating ideas, and explaining code when needed. Additionally, API and Streamlit documentation, along with general research, were consulted to complete the project. 


Problems & Solutions: Many challenges arose during this project. The main obstacles included identifying a problem in the community and addressing it through the application, utlizing specific Streamlit features, connecting with APIs, ensuring correct results from the API, and handling edge cases. Various tools were used to overcome these challenges. Extensive research, careful planning and designing, and consulting with knowledgeable individuals were extremely helpful. Additionally, thoroughly reading the documentation made understanding and implementing the code much easier. As the project progressed, new edge cases emerged, which required careful consideration to prevent issues for end users.
